Most use cases for buildFHSUserEnv include running dynamically linked binaries
built for FHS-compliant Linux distributions. Sometimes these are wrapped with a
shell script that rewrites LD_LIBRARY_PATH: see #21109, #31136, and a few other
cases not on bug tracker (RPG Maker MV on Steam).

Additionally, we currently use LD_LIBRARY_PATH for OpenGL.

To make sure no one overrides our library paths, add NIX_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

_dl_fatal_printf doesn't report strerror(errno) because it causes compilation
errors that, while can be fixed, require adding weak attribute to quite a few
symbols which results in a much larger and thus less maintainable patch.
