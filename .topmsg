Subject: [PATCH] nix2/package-updates

various package updates.
Yes - maybe I should have used different topic branches for each.
This is faster for me

this branch contains package updates for various reasons
    
wireshark: old source vanished
buildenv.pl: fix some cases viric discovered
chrome: pass libXdamage
linuxtv_dvb_apps: new package
nvi: new source (version bump) (old 404)
mercurial:
  - vesrion update ( now supports revsets and maybe more)
  - plugin support. Supporting / enabling
      svn (by convert and extension)
      mq, pbranch, translate, ..
poppler update (keep old version to build inkscape)
umtsmon: added
fix wvdial (wvstreams patch)
python: adding pip tool

adding tinyproxy, ziproxy

ghc: enable parallel building

adding apvlv (pdf viewer with vi like keybindings)

updating upstart completion

texLive's man is broken (second line is a dir not an executable) and
very annoying: it shadowns man (linux help) - removing it

add mergeShellCode function and option merge function used by the nixos
patch introducing support for multiple shells

adding path-selector script which is essential (probably to me only)

opera:
    Opera update

    Major change: Opera is based on X now optionally using GTK, QT, KDE
    toolkits for GUI.

    GTK seems to work. QT starts (the open dialog does not
    show icons). KDE does not start.
    See comments to learn about how to choose one of those toolkits.

    merged update provided by Kevin Quick on the mailinglist

scons:
  use PATH always from env because the default /bin:/usr/bin:.. doesn't make
  sense for NixOS. It seems that Peter Simons doesn't like it for whatever reason
  I don't understand

updating upstart to 1.0 it was announced on the mailinglist. Not all jobs have been retested yet.

adding smlnj
adding fish shell

shadow: useradd: dereference /etc/skel/* symlinks so that files are put into home directories Also enable parallel building

builderdefs: enable parallel building and add verbose script

sourceAndTags: ruby support
adding networkmanager
adding anyterm

pidigin:
     new attr: pidgin plugins (TODO move all plugins there)
     + plugin pidgin-bot-sentry-1.3.0

postfix: update

gptfdisk provided by Shea Levy

haskellMode (emacs): update source
