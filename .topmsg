Subject: [PATCH] nix2/deepfun-cleanup

removing deepOverride. The replacement pkgsFunDeepOverride doesn't suffer from
- maybe overriding args which are named the same way by accident
- because it forced adding , ...) to some packages
  which "weakens the precision of the function interface definitios"
  (quoting Eelco Dolsta)
