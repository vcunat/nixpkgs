Subject: [PATCH] nix2/overlays

allow finding overlays by name in same directory where nixpkgs is. This is nice for experimenting
Example: nixpkgs-haskell-overlay, nixpkgs-ruby-overlay (they do already work)
nixpkgs-python-overlay is planned

The reason for "overlays" is to keep nixpkgs modular. Some subuniverses such as python, scala, haskell, perl, ..
should be kept separate to reduce noise on the main repo - and because the
dumps of package sources (hackage, rubygems, pypi, ...) are quite large.
